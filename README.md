# Programming - Postfix Calculator
Implementation of Reverse-Polish Notation to solve an expression or equation that contains parentheses.

Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands(wikipedia). 

2nd semester final project for programming practice 2.
using postfix algorithm, stack, and linkedList for parentheses in an expression.
not fixed: linkedList pointer. after all data is popped from the stack (null pointer exception). no library allowed at that time :(
